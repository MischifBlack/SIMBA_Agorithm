# SIMBA_Agorithm
This Algorithm program OPD is write by Matlab scripts,and designed for automatic interfaces detection of SIMBA data.
As one open source project,everyone could free attain these source files.
Composed by 7 scripts, several modules have assemble in this OPD algorithm.




this algorithm need user input several initial parameters for program running.They are all marked by the sensor numbers of SIMBA buoy thermodynamic chain.










We also packed one sample buoy data FMI02 into this project,so that anyone could test those source file by itself.
